//Tower of Hanoi â€“ The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical problem which consists of three rods and multiple disks. Initially, all the disks are placed on one rod, one over the other in ascending order of size similar to a cone-shaped tower.

        return;
    }

    cout << "Move disk " << n << " from " << source << " to " << destination << endl;
